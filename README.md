## 🤝 Contribution Guidelines

We welcome contributions! But please follow these rules strictly:

### 1. Use Conventional Commits ✅
Follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) format:

```
<type>(<scope>): <message>
```

**Examples:**
- feat(auth): add user login functionality
- fix(ui): resolve navbar alignment issue
- chore(deps): update react version

---

### 2. Work Only on the `dev` Branch 🌿
- **DO NOT** push changes directly to the `main` branch.
- Always create and work on feature branches from `dev`.

```bash
git checkout dev
git pull origin dev
git checkout -b feat/new-feature
```

---
### 3. Create Pull Requests for Every Issue 🔄
- For each change, create a **separate branch**.
- Make your changes and **commit them properly**.
- Open a **Pull Request (PR)** to merge into the `dev` branch.
- If your PR **fixes or resolves** any issue, **link the related issue(s)** in the PR description using  
  `#<issue-number>`  
  *(Example: `#12` if your PR fixes issue 12)*.
- Do **not** link unrelated issues.
